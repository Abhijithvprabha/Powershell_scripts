PowerShell script that prompts the user to enter an Active Directory group name and then removes all members from that group:
# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Prompt for the AD group name
$groupName = Read-Host "Enter the name of the AD group"

# Get the group object
$group = Get-ADGroup -Identity $groupName -ErrorAction Stop

# Get all members of the group
$groupMembers = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupName

# Check if the group has any members
if ($groupMembers.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "The group '$groupName' has no members."
} else {
    # Remove each member from the group
    foreach ($member in $groupMembers) {
        try {
            Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupName -Members $member -Confirm:$false
            Write-Host "Removed $($member.Name) from $groupName"
        } catch {
            Write-Host "Failed to remove $($member.Name) from $groupName. Error: $_"
        }
    }
    Write-Host "All members have been removed from the group '$groupName'."
}
