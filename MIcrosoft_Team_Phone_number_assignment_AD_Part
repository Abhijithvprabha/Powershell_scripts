Preparing the AD profile of a user to assign Team phone number in MS team admin center / Work related ; where I have exisitng an office 365 domestic calling license group 


# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Prompt the user for input
$DisplayName = Read-Host "Enter the display name"
$PhoneNumber = Read-Host "Enter the phone number"
$EmailAddress = Read-Host "Enter the user's email address"

# Find the user account based on display name
$User = Get-ADUser -Filter "DisplayName -eq '$DisplayName'"

# Check if the user account exists
if ($User -ne $null) {
    # Print the username to the user
    Write-Host "Username for display name '$DisplayName' is $($User.SamAccountName)"

    # Set the IP phone number, telephone number, and SIP address
    Set-ADUser -Identity $User -Replace @{ipPhone = $PhoneNumber; telephoneNumber = $PhoneNumber}
    $sipAddress = "sip:$EmailAddress"
    Set-ADUser -Identity $User -Add @{proxyAddresses = $sipAddress}

    # Add user to the group
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "MX_O365_Domestic_Calling" -Members $User

    Write-Host "IP phone number, telephone number, and SIP address '$PhoneNumber' added successfully to user '$($User.SamAccountName)'."
    Write-Host "User '$($User.SamAccountName)' added to the 'MX_O365_Domestic_Calling' group."
} else {
    Write-Host "User with display name '$DisplayName' not found in Active Directory."
}
