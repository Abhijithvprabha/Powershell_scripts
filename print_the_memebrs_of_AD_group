 print the members of an Active Directory group to the screen using PowerShell. Here's a script to accomplish that:


# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Ask the user for the group name
$groupName = Read-Host -Prompt 'Please enter the name of the AD security group'

# Get the group
$group = Get-ADGroup -Identity $groupName

# Check if the group exists
if ($group) {
    # Get the members of the group
    $members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupName

    # Print the members
    $members | Format-Table -Property Name, SamAccountName, ObjectClass
} else {
    Write-Host "The group '$groupName' does not exist."
}
