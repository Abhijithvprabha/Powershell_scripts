PowerShell script that will prompt for a user's email address and then print out any delegate or forwarding setups associated with that mailbox:

# Prompt the user to enter the email address
$userEmail = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the user's email address"

# Check and print any delegate access
Write-Host "`nChecking for delegates assigned to $userEmail..."
$delegates = Get-CalendarProcessing -Identity $userEmail | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ResourceDelegates
if ($delegates) {
    Write-Host "Delegates found:"
    $delegates
} else {
    Write-Host "No delegates found."
}

# Check and print any forwarding rules
Write-Host "`nChecking for forwarding rules in $userEmail's mailbox..."
$forwardingRules = Get-InboxRule -Mailbox $userEmail | Where-Object {$_.ForwardTo -ne $null -or $_.ForwardAsAttachmentTo -ne $null}
if ($forwardingRules) {
    Write-Host "Forwarding rules found:"
    $forwardingRules | Format-Table Name, ForwardTo, ForwardAsAttachmentTo
} else {
    Write-Host "No forwarding rules found."
}

Write-Host "`nCheck completed."
