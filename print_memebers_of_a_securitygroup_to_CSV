Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Ask the user for the group name
$groupName = Read-Host -Prompt 'Please enter the name of the AD security group'

# Get the group
$group = Get-ADGroup -Identity $groupName

# Check if the group exists
if ($group) {
    # Get the members of the group
    $members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupName

    # Array to store member details
    $memberDetails = @()

    # Loop through each member
    foreach ($member in $members) {
        $userDetails = Get-ADUser -Identity $member.SamAccountName -Properties Name, EmailAddress
        $memberDetails += [PSCustomObject]@{
            'Name'           = $userDetails.Name
            'SamAccountName' = $member.SamAccountName
            'ObjectClass'    = $member.ObjectClass
            'EmailAddress'   = $userDetails.EmailAddress
        }
    }

    # Display the members with email addresses
    $memberDetails | Format-Table -AutoSize

    # Save to CSV
    $memberDetails | Export-Csv C:\Mystuff\ADGroupMembers.csv" 

    Write-Host "Results saved to C:\Mystuff\"
